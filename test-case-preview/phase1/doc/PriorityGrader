Purpose:
Test the priority scheduler (nachos.threads.PriorityScheduler).

Usage:
-- nachos.ag.PriorityGrader -# threads=xxx,times=xxx,length=xxx

History:
2008-11-20 Xiangru Chen: The first version.
	This version can only verify that your scheduler does not do things obviously wrong,
	and it knows nothing about priority donation.

Arguments:
threads: the number of threads to be forked.
times: the number of times to run the test.
length: the lifetime of each thread, the bigger value leads to longer execute time.

Note:
	It is recommended that this grader should run with the ThreadedKernel,
	because the kernel threads of later phases (if there is) may corrupt the test.
