	Test whether the priority scheduler can properly solve the problem of priority inversion.
	It will test the priority donation when using locks, and also when using the join operation.

Note:
	It is recommended that this grader should run with the ThreadedKernel,
	because the kernel threads of later phases (if there is) may corrupt the test.
