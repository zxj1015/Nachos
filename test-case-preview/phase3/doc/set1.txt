Testcase Set 1 for Phase 3 (Caching and Virtual Memory): basic requirments
=================== vm_echo ===================
Purpose:
Test your arguments passing, with a simple echo program.
It needs a demand-load page for passing arguments, before the thread is actually forked.

Usage:
-- nachos.ag.VMGrader -x vm_echo.coff -# output=vm_echo.out

2010-01-16 Cheng Yu: The first version.

=================== vm_lazyload ===============
Purpose:
Test whether the system uses lazy-loading.

Usage:
-- nachos.ag.VMGrader -x vm_lazyload.coff -# swapFile=VirtualMemory.bak

Author:
Xiangru Chen

History:
2008-12-26 Xiangru Chen: The first version.

Arguments:
swapFile: the name of the swap file.

Restrictions:
To run this test, the number of physical pages should be no more than 16.

=================== vm_reuse ==================
Purpose:
Test whether the system can reuse the spaces in swap file left by the finished processes.

Usage:
-- nachos.ag.VMGrader -x vm_reuse.coff -# coffPar0=xxx,swapFile=xxx

History:
2008-12-26 Xiangru Chen: The first version.

Dependencies:
vm_reuse_child.coff

Arguments:
coffPar0: number of child processes that will be forked. 10 is recommended.
swapFile: the name of the swap file.

Sample:
-- nachos.ag.VMGrader -x vm_reuse.coff -# coffPar0=10,swapFile=SWAP0

Restrictions:
To run this test, the number of physical pages should be no more than 4.

=================== vm_recursion ==============
Purpose:
Test the demand paging and reading/writing memory.

Usage:
-- nachos.ag.VMGrader -x vm_recursion.coff -# coffPar0=xxx,coffPar1=xxx,swapFile=xxx

Author:
Xiangru Chen

History:
2008-12-26 Xiangru Chen: The first version.

Arguments:
coffPar0: the depth of the recursion. At each level, an array of page-size will be placed in the stack.
coffPar1: the skip factor. It means that, only (PAGE_SIZE / (2 ^ "skip factor")) bytes in each page will be used. When the test seems too slow, increase this value to speed it up.
swapFile: the name of the swap file.

Sample:
-- nachos.ag.VMGrader -x vm_recursion.coff -# coffPar0=20,coffPar1=0,swapFile=SWAP0

Restrictions:
To run this test, the number of physical pages should be no more than 16.

Note:
This test needs a stack of more than 8 pages, if your stack size is fixed at 8, you can feel free to ignore this test:p
